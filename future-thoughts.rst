Future thoughts
===============

On the scientific side, khmer's future will be driven by research needs.

On the software engineering/community/maintenance side:

* rename to oxli & use subcommands - not urgent, but should happen;
  
* lots of stuff in the `meta issues <https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+meta>`__.

* should we try out the `pull request hack <https://github.com/dib-lab/khmer/issues/1291>`__?

Things to discuss
-----------------

* Should we try to cater to a larger community or is it a waste of time?

  To expand:

  one approach is to try to make khmer more broadly useful by
  implementing more well-rounded features (exact graph storage, for
  example; exact k-mer abundance tables; etc.) within the same or
  similar API.  This would also potentially involve more community
  engagement.

  Another approach is to simply do high visibility
  research. Experience suggests that people will simply come use the
  software if it does highly visible things.

  Of course we'll pursue a blended model. The question is, how blended?

* Would more funding be useful or a hindrance? Who would pay attention to
  the software engineering?

Things I'm personally not considering
-------------------------------------

Introducing support for multi-node parallelism.
